## Go API

A barebones Go API service.

## Development

Make sure you have [Go](https://golang.org) and the [Widemesh CLI](https://widemesh.com/installation) installed.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/widemeshcloud/go-api-quickstart.git # or clone your own fork
$ cd go-api-quickstart
$ go build
$ ./go-api-quickstart
```

Your go service should now be running on localhost:5000.

## Deploying

```
$ mesh deploy
```
